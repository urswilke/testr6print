# testr6print

The goal of testr6print is to show how to modify the printing behaviour of a 
subclass of the `"tbl_df"` class in the tibble package. 
The part that made it work (I believe) was to add the `@importFrom` and `@export`
comments.

```
#' @importFrom pillar ctl_new_rowid_pillar
#' @export
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of testr6print like so (but it should also be enough to just browse in this git repo).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("urswilke/testr6print")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how the modified tibble print of the 
object in a field of the dummy class

```{r}
library(testr6print)
MyClass$new()
```
